This is nginx 1.10.1 with gridfs module, as well as special support
for Duckling-CLB.

./configure --prefix=/usr/local/nginx-clb --add-module=./nginx-gridfs-module
make
make install

Notice: The CFLAG '-Werror' is turned off because this mongo-c-driver has
warnings on 'signed-compare'.

nginx-gridfs --> https://github.com/mdirolf/nginx-gridfs
mongo-c-driver --> https://github.com/eagleas/mongo-c-driver

Unfortunately, at the nginx-gridfs' github page, the link to
mongo-c-driver is with wrong version/commit. Moreover, the project
seems to be stopped. 
So, please be caution when updating next time.
